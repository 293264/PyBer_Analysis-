Overview of the analysis:
In this project, we will perform an analysis of PyBer ride sharing data so that we can gain a better understanding of how ridership and fares relate to the types of cities in which PyBer operates. We will also create visualizations that will assist in summarizing how the data differs by city type(Urban, Suburban, Rural) and how those difference can assist decision-makers at PyBer. 


Results:
According to the ride-sharing data-frame summary, more rides are taken in Urban cities than Suburban or Rural areas. Also, the number of drivers follows this pattern with most drivers located in Urban areas. There is a significant difference between the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver in rural and urban areas. This indicates that as more ride-share drivers are available, the fares or expenses per ride become cheaper on average. Yet, on the other hand, there is an important piece of information missing: the length of the ride. It may be that long rides are required in rural areas, so the data is skewed to reflect higher fares due to their length.



Summary:
The Multiline graph shows fares for various city types (Urban, Suburban, and Rural) over time. Though there are some spikes in the data here and there, the graph is generally stable. The graph also reveals that most of the money is made in Urban cities followed by Suburban and Rural respectively. It is also evident from the summary data-frame and graph that although a rural ride has a higher average fare, more money is made from Urban rides overall.
