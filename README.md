**Overview of the analysis**

The objective of this analysis is to create a DataFrame of the Pyber ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, in a written report,  describe how data differs based on the type of city and how that information can be utilized by PyBer decision-makers.


**Results**

According to the ride-sharing data-frame summary

* When compared to suburban and rural cities, urban cities account for about 68% of total rides.

* The number of drivers residing in urban areas makes up about 81 percent of those residing in suburban and rural areas.

* Urban cities account for about 63% of total fares, when compared with suburban and rural cities. 

* Rural areas rank highest in Average Fare per Ride and Driver among city types.


**Summary** 

Among all city types, urban cities rank highest in Total Rides, Drivers, and Fares. It should come as no surprise; due to heavy traffic, fewer people in urban areas own cars, and they tend to rely more on public transportation to get around. The number of rides recorded in rural areas is only 5%, ranking last among city types. However, rural cities show much higher average fares per driver and per ride than suburban and urban cities. This could indicate that rural based riders are traveling longer distances. When there aren't enough drivers to meet the demand, this can be an issue. On recommendation would be place more driver in rural area to meet the demand for ridership. PyBer could lose customers due to a shortage of drivers if more drivers are not placed in rural areas.

Another way to look at the analysis is to argue that there are fewer trips in rural areas because more people have cars there. In that case, Pyber shouldn't make any changes to its rural driver count. My recommendation to the company is to conduct a survey about the primary mode of transportation of its rural customers. In the survey, you can ask about the number of vehicles per household and how often they use public transportation to get around.
